# IngrediScan (I.S.I.T)
### A mobile solution for ingredient transparency and nutritional clarity

## Description
We aim to create a mobile app to improve health and nutrition transparency. Users will be able to scan nutrition labels on food items, and the app will provide a detailed description of each of its ingredients, making complex ingredients more accessible and understandable. Additionally, the app will highlight artificial additives and nutritional benefits, helping users make informed dietary choices. The app will also have a feature where users can add scanned food labels to their daily diet, tracking the number of calories and food groups they consume per day, further promoting health accessibility. Users can also create a personalized profile to indicate their dietary preferences and receive personalized recommendations based on their health goals. One challenge is finding a method to integrate camera scanning within the app. We are unsure whether the camera scanning will involve machine learning algorithms to grab important ingredient info, special API calls, or a combination of both in real time. We also anticipate having the challenge of managing a large and growing database of food products and whether the size of the database will affect runtime speed.
